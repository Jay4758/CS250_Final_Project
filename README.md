# CS250 Final Project - Jason Morocho

## Project Overview

This project involved developing a travel app using Scrum-Agile methodologies. We focused on implementing a destination filter feature, iterating based on user feedback, and adapting to changes during the development process. Below are the files associated with this project:

## Reflections on Essential Questions

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**  
Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the clientâ€™s requirements through tools like user stories. For this project, user stories helped break down the features we needed to implement. They acted as a guide for the development team to ensure that we stayed on track with what the client expected.

**2. How does creating "user stories" help with this?**  
Creating user stories helped organize the tasks in smaller increments, making it easier to prioritize and deliver features in sprints. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, we used user stories to structure the development of a destination filter feature, which evolved with feedback across sprints.

**3. How do I approach developing programs?**  
My approach to program development follows a structured but flexible process. I prefer to work in short sprints, where we continuously test and refine our features. This ensures early feedback and allows changes to be made incrementally without causing major disruptions.

**4. What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I plan to continue using Agile processes such as daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives in my future projects. These processes help improve communication, manage project scope, and enhance team collaboration. They also allow me to adapt to changes more easily, as seen when we shifted to a mobile-first approach in the SNHU Travel project.

**5. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member involves clear communication, active participation, and a willingness to collaborate. In our team, we worked together during daily standups to ensure everyone was on the same page and addressed any blockers immediately. This not only helped the project move forward but also fostered a strong team dynamic.
